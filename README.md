# SimpleStackSmashAttackMiniTutorial
## Shellcode Injection + Buffer Overflow Exploit
_Uses C and Python languages_
A mini demonstration of how to execute a simple stack smash attack (this is not a personal project; I'm just trying out what I learned).

(This is my LEVEL 1 repository. I am just playing around with what I have learned while adding a bit of my own twist to it, but this is not a full on personal project. Credits go to Dhaval Kapil for his notes on the Buffer Overflow Exploit and Shellcode Injection blog entries.)
